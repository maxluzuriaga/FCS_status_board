FCS Status Board
================

If anyone wants to fork the repo and do these, be my guest.

- FCS logo instead of name
- Constant header/footer, dynamic middle (vert height)
- Scrolling announcements in footer
- Figure out season based on current date for color scheme
- Highlight background of current class
- Weather isn't accurate, change the API (Yahoo weather?)
